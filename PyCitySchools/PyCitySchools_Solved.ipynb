    "* Charter Schools seemed to outperform the District schools interms of overall passing rate. The top 5 schools by passing rate were all charter schools, while the bottom 5 were all district schools. In fact, none of the district schools outperformed a charter school in overall passing rate. There was a precipitous drop of 20% in overall passing rate between the worst charter school and the best district school!\n",
    "\n",
    "* However, this trend could related to school size. There was a strong inverse relationship between school size and performace; smaller schools tended to be more sucessful, and on average, Charter schools had less than half the number of students than the district schools. One explanation for this trend is the potential for higher teacher/student ratios, though there wasn't any data on the number of teachers per school. While there was a significant difference in the school size of charter vs district schools, it is unknown whether this is a causative relationship. Charter schools may just be a more obscure than district schools, and if enough district students transferred to charter schools so that their populations were equal, the test scores might equalize as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Overall, the district performed about 10% higher in reading than it did in math (86% reading vs 75% math). Furthermore, math scores for the district schools averaged lower than 70%! This would likely be a high priority area for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, there appears to be a counterintuitive inverese relationship between the per student budget and the overall passing rates of the students. The schools with a lower per student budget tended to perform better on average. However, this could be misleading, as the observed difference in each school's per student budget was small and likely to be insignificant. The difference between the largest and the smallest per student budget ($655 vs $578) was only 11%, a minor difference. In contrast, the diffence in school size between the largest and the smallest was 5,000 to 400, over a 1200% difference! These data could suggest that scaling a school's budget linearly with school size does not adequetely give the school enough resources to serve its students.\n",
